## Introduction

<Here you should have a few paragraphs of text introducing the problem, getting the reader interested/ready for the rest of the report.>

<Introduce terminology.>

<Highlight hypotheses.>

<Optional: You can also include a description of each section of this report as a last paragraph.>


## Data

<Type here a paragraph introducing the data, its context and as much info about the data collection process that you know.>


```{r, include = FALSE}

# Here you can load in and clean the census data (you may need to do the cleaning in a separate R script). 

census_data <- read_csv("gss_clean.csv")

# You may need additional chunks, in case you want to include some of the cleaning output.

```


<Type here a summary of the cleaning process (**only add in stuff beyond my original gss_cleaning.R code**). You only need to describe additional cleaning that you and your group did.> ] You will need to describe the cleaning you do to the survey data as well. 


```{r, include = FALSE}

# Here you can load in and clean the survey data. 
# All cleaning must be done in the same Rmd file as your final report. 
# All cleaning must not be shown in the submitted pdf. 
# Setting the cleaning chunk to include = FALSE will allow for this. 

load('ces2021.RData')

## The data dictionary is found in '2021 Canadian Election Study Codebook.pdf'
## In the data dictionary you can find the survey questions/responses corresponding to the column names in survey_data. 
## For example 

# cps21_age: Respondent age in years. Calculated from cps21_yob.
## cps21_votechoice: "Which party do you think you will vote for? - Selected Choice"

## Furthermore, when you select a variable in the survey_data, you will also see a description of the variable!. 
## If it's a categorical variable, you'll also see how it's coded! 
## For example: 

# suvey_data$cps21_votechoice
# attr(,"label")
# [1] "Which party do you think you will vote for? - Selected Choice"
# attr(,"format.stata")
# [1] "%32.0g"
# attr(,"class")
# [1] "haven_labelled"
# attr(,"labels")
#                    Liberal Party               Conservative Party                              ndp 
#                                1                                2                                3 
#                   Bloc Québécois                      Green Party   Another party (please specify) 
#                                4                                5                                6 
# Don't know/ Prefer not to answer 
#                                7

<Include a clear description of the plot(s). I would recommend one paragraph for each plot.> 


## Methods

<Include some text introducing the methodology, maybe restating the problem/goal of this analysis.>


### Model Specifics
<Here you can describe your regression model>

<I will (incorrectly) be using a linear regression model to model the proportion of voters who will vote for the liberal party. This is a naive model. I will only be using age, which is recorded as a numeric variable, to model the probability of voting for the liberal party. The simple linear regression model I am using is:> 

$$ y = \beta_0+\beta_1  x_{age} + \epsilon$$

<Where $y$ represents the ....  $\beta_0$ represents....>

```{r, include=FALSE}

# Creating the Model
model <- lm(vote_liberal ~ age, gender, language, quebec, income, religion, minority, data=survey_data)

# Model Results (to Report in Results section)
# summary(model)
# OR
# broom::tidy(model)

### Don't show the results/output here...

```


## Post-Stratification 

<Here you should explain the poststratification process>

<In order to estimate the proportion of voters.....>

<To put math/LaTeX inline just use one set of dollar signs. Example: $\hat{y}^{PS}$ >

<To put math on its own line use two sets of dollar signs:>

$$ include.your.mathematical.model.here.if.you.have.some.math.to.show $$


All analysis for this report was programmed using `R version 4.0.2`. 



## Results 

```{r, include=FALSE}

# Creating the Model
model <- lm(vote_liberal ~ age, data=survey_data)

# Model Results (to Report in Results section)
# summary(model)
# OR
# broom::tidy(model)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}

# Here I will perform the post-stratification calculation
census_data_counts <- census_data %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())

census_data_counts$estimate <-
  model %>%
  predict(newdata = census_data_counts)

census_data_counts %>% 
  mutate(liberal_predict_prop = estimate*n) %>%
  summarise(liberal_predict = sum(liberal_predict_prop)/sum(n))

```

<Here you present your results. You may want to put them into a well formatted table. Be sure that there is some text describing the results.>


<Note: Alternatively you can use the `knitr::kable` function to create a well formatted table from your code. See here: [https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html).>



<Remember you can use `r ` to use inline R code.>


```{r, include = FALSE}

# Here you can include some relevant visualizations.


```

<Include an explanation/interpretation of the visualizations. Make sure to comment on the appropriateness of the assumptions/results.>

## Conclusions

<Here you should give a summary of the Hypotheses, Methods and Results>

<Highlight Key Results.>

<Talk about big picture.>

<Comment on any Weaknesses.>

<Comment on Future Work/Next Steps>

<End with a concluding paragraph to wrap up the report.>

## Appendix

## Generative AI Statement

Here is where you can explain your usage of Generative AI tool(s). Be sure to reference it. For instance, including something like: 

I used the following generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool: Bing AI Version 2.0 for Chrome [4]. I used the tool only in the Results section of this assignment and I gave it the following prompt of `What should I eat for breakfast?` and it gave me a list of 10 breakfast items which I then asked it to: `Please only list breakfast items that do not include eggs`. I then chose my 3 favourite items from the produced list and included those in the Results section.
